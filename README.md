JS Auto DeObfuscator v.5 by Luciano Giuseppe: http://sites.google.com/site/lucianogiuseppeprogrammi/
========================


##About
This tool helps security researches to speed up their work: it's useful where a js uses eval or some other function, one or more time, to de-obfuscat it-self.
It uses to work as default browser Firefox, but at last line of the source you can change firefox with an other browser as Chrome, obviously.


##How to use
You can call this script with args: "obf.html eval 0" to don't let's execute eval in obf.html and get all js code executed, or you can increment 0 to 1 to let execute eval one time , for example: the first time with eval there are some variables declaration.
